	<h2>What is Django?</h2>
	<p>Django is a Python framework that makes it easier to create web sites using Python.</p>
	<p>Django takes care of the difficult stuff so that you can concentrate on building your web applications.</p>
	<p>Django emphasizes reusability of components, also referred to as DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself), and comes with
		ready-to-use features like login system, database connection and CRUD operations (Create Read Update Delete).
	</p>
	<h2>How does Django Work?</h2>
	<p>Django follows the MVT design pattern (Model View Template).</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Model - The data you want to present, usually data from a database.</li>
		<li>View - A request handler that returns the relevant template and content - based on the request from the user.</li>
		<li>Template - A text file (like an HTML file) containing the layout of the web page, with logic on how to display the data.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Django History</h2>
	<p>Django was invented by Lawrence Journal-World in 2003, to meet the short deadlines in the newspaper and at the same time meeting the demands of experienced web developers.</p>
	<p>Initial release to the public was in July 2005.</p>
	<p>Latest version of Django is 5.1.6 (February 2025).</p>
